## What is this?
This website is where I'll document the development process of my custom Framework-based 18" laptop, the ReFrame 18. At the conclusion of the project, the part list and design files will also be available in their own GitHub repository.

## Why?
I wanted a bigger screen, even more I/O, and a mechanical keyboard.

## How?
Most of the hardware will come from the [Framework Laptop 16](https://frame.work/laptop16). When choosing parts, compatibility, simplicity and obtainability will be the most important factors. This project is still in an extremely early stage, but the general goals are as follows:
- Framework 16 mainboard, cooling, etc.
- Compatibility with Framework 16 graphics modules
- 18" 16:10 display
- Retain all 6 Framework expansion card slots, while adding additional I/O
- Mechanical keyboard with numpad
- Framework 16 trackpad
- Anodized aluminum chassis

## What now?
I'll start the design process by designing the top cover to accommodate the display I've chosen and the Framework 16 webcam module, along with the Framework 16 hinges. I'll detail the display I selected, its interface, and the design of the top cover in my next post. This will determine the overall width and depth of the laptop before I move on to the other parts. Stay tuned for updates!
